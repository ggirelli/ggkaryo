Description: ggkaryo2 is fully based on ggplot. It allows to plot a simple
	karyotype, or a karyotype with one/multiple data-track profile(s). This can
	be useful when visualizing multiple informations, as it allows to easily
	identify the localization (e.g., genomic coordinate, location relative to
	centromere/telomeres, ...) of any region of interest based on a data-track
	profile. The karyotype is automatically built from a giemsa-staining bed
	file, and the data-track are added as additional bed files. ggkaryo2 supports
	simultaneously plotting, onto a karyotype, any number of data-tracks as
	profiles, and to highlight loci of interest. Being fully based on ggplot,
	the users can easily customize a ggkaryo2 plot and add their own custom
	layers to it.
